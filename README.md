# TGC-MODEL
This project implements the TGC model, which uses a graph-based approach with Transaction Graph Contrastive Learning to detect phishing nodes, leveraging DGL and PyTorch to learn node embeddings with a Graph Attention Network encoder and contrastive loss, and an XGBoost classifier for improved precision and recall.
